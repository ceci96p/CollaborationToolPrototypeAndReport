# CollaborationToolPrototypeAndReport

This prototype usability study focused in studying a technology advancement design through the comparison of the 
favorability and cognitive load of two medium-fidelity prototypes, as the objective was to develop a single online
program that would integrate messaging and file-sharing. This project was created for the Computer Science course, 
Advanced Methods for Human-Computer Interaction (CPSC 444) at the University of British Columbia.

I was responsible for developing the concept for the project, while the scope and focus of the study were 
re-conceptualized by the group. The experiment was run with two researchers at all time for each individual, so I 
took part in the experiment sessions while I was in charge of developing and building the desktop prototype. The blog
was written amongst all the members of the group as the analysis of the study, the methods and quantitative results 
were also all done in group, yet each member of the group had to write the report individually. I was also in charge of 
filming and editing the demo video for the project. This project was done in collaboration with three other students, A.L,
C.L, and M.K.

The project was developed in the premise of developing a new or improved version of existing programs and the analyzing in 
more detail the interfaces with given theories in HCI, quantitative statistics like ANOVA and qualitative statistics like 
NASA-TLX.
